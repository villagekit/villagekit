# Village Kit

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

Village Kit is a future-thinking code-as-CAD system for open source makers.

The Village Kit system is:

- A code-as-CAD framework for designing parametric products
- A public repository to share and import open source products

Then later:

- An e-commerce store for browsing products for sale
- A marketplace to connect consumers with a network of suppliers

There are 4 types of products:

- Solid: A 3d object printed or CNC'd
- Sheet: A 2d object cut from sheet material
- Stock: An off-the-shelf product
- Assembly: A composition of other products

Each of these can be parametric, which means using these, you can make most anything. See [NopSCADlib](https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib) for more inspiration.

To prove the concept, products are currently written as [Rust code](https://rust-lang.org). The goal is to transition to a more fit-for-purpose language, aka [Kitty Lang](https://github.com/villagekit/kittylang).

If you want to see this happen, consider reaching out or [sponsoring @ahdinosaur](https://github.com/sponsors/ahdinosaur).

For the previous proof-of-concept, see [a catalog of grid beam products](https://gridkit-landing-villagekit.vercel.app/) made from [gridkit-legacy](https://github.com/villagekit/gridkit-legacy) and [gridkit-products](https://github.com/villagekit/gridkit-products).
